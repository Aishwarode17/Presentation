        <h2>üìú Idea </h2>
        <p>
          A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) detects malicious traffic on a network. NIDS usually require promiscuous network access in order to analyze all traffic. NIDS can be hardware or software-based systems.Oftentimes, NIDS have two network interfaces. One is used for listening to network conversations in promiscuous mode and the other is used for control and reporting.
        </p>
        The NIDS derives its name from the fact that it monitors the entire network. More accurately, it monitors an entire network segment.An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system
        <p>
          There is a wide array of IDS, ranging from antivirus software to tiered monitoring systems that follow the traffic of an entire network. The most common classifications are:
          Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS): A system that analyzes incoming network traffic.
          Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS): A system that monitors important operating system files.

        <h2>The Need</h2>

        <p>
          Modern networked business environments require a high level of security to ensure safe and trusted communication of information between various organizations. An intrusion detection system acts as an adaptable safeguard technology for system security after traditional technologies fail. Cyber attacks will only become more sophisticated, so it is important that protection technologies adapt along with their threats.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Present State</h2>

        <p>
          At present state most network intrusion detection systems ,monitor the traffic and report anomalous behaviours and policy voiolation, by creating compact transition logs suitabale for manual review .

        <h2>üåÆ Detection methods of IDS</h2>

        <h3>Signature-based</h3>
        <p>
          Signature-based IDS detects possible threats by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware. This terminology originates from antivirus software, which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is impossible to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.
        </p>
        <h3>Anomaly based</h3>
        <p>
          Anomaly-based: a newer technology designed to detect and adapt to unknown attacks, primarily due to the explosion of malware. This detection method uses machine learning to create a defined model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this trust model. While this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it can suffer from false positives: previously unknown legitimate activity can accidentally be classified as malicious.
